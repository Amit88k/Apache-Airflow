We have tasks t1, t2 and t3 in tutorial.py that do not depend on each other. Here’s a few ways you can define dependencies between them:

t1.set_downstream(t2)

# This means that t2 will depend on t1
# running successfully to run.
# It is equivalent to:
t2.set_upstream(t1)

# The bit shift operator can also be
# used to chain operations:
t1 >> t2

# And the upstream dependency with the
# bit shift operator:
t2 << t1

# Chaining multiple dependencies becomes
# concise with the bit shift operator:
t1 >> t2 >> t3

# A list of tasks can also be set as
# dependencies. These operations
# all have the same effect:
t1.set_downstream([t2, t3])
t1 >> [t2, t3]
[t2, t3] << t1
